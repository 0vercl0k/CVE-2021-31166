The bug itself happens in `http!UlpParseContentCoding` where the function has a local `LIST_ENTRY` and appends item to it. When it's done, it moves it into the `Request` structure; but it doesn't NULL out the local list. The issue with that is that an attacker can trigger a code-path that frees every entries of the local list leaving them dangling in the `Request` object.
